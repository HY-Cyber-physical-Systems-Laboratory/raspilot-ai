This is a collection of common files for accessing mpu6050 sensor in
raspilot. Unfortunately I do not remember from where exactly this code
comes but I think that credits shall go to Jeff Rowberg and Richard
Hirst:

It was slightly modified to make it working with raspilot, in
particular to use pi2c library to access i2c bus.
